Anime Finding Website
This website helps users search for animes that they by the keywords in their search. The websites help link animes to the myanimelist website with the help of the kitsu api key. The reason why i made this website is because this website helps classify animes in categories hence users can browse multiple categories with the same keyword, as if users go to directly to the site they might be overwhelmed by the variety and might not know what to choose. There is also a recommandation page where users can write down animes they think that are good. There is also a feedback page to helo gather feedback about the website. 

Getting Started
Search for animes in the search bar and results will appear, in different categories. For example, if you search for jujutsu kaisen, the anime will appear, hence you can press on find out more to go the page on myanimelist. Results of other animes with similiar keywords will also appear, hence if a user is unsure of the name of an anime or they only know a partial part of the name, results of animes with similar names will appear hence users can search for it. There is also a feedback page to receive feedback, users will enter their name, country, email and feedback. There is also a recommendation part where users can add names of anime and why they like it.

Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

Break down into end to end tests
I tested the website and there were problems the first few tries. I could not add animes in the recommendation section add first due too using the wrong javascript file. I also had some trouble with the colours as there were many pages, hence the naming might have been mixed up, for example the colour of the card for the animes was white instead of grey as i had used the wrong class in the anime.css file. Could not input in feedback form due to wrong input style. Navbar did not go to the page desired as it was linked to the wrong pages at first.
